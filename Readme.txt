#Certainly! Here's a step-by-step documentation for the code:

   import subprocess

#The code imports the subprocess module, which allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.


data = (
    subprocess.check_output(["netsh", "wlan", "show", "profiles"])
    .decode("utf-8")
    .split("\n")
)

#The " subprocess.check_output() " function is used to execute the command " netsh wlan show profiles " in the Windows command prompt and retrieve the output.
" check_output() " returns the output as a byte string, so .decode("utf-8") is used to convert it to a string.
The string is then split into a list of lines using " .split("\n") " and stored in the data variable.



profiles = [i.split(":")[1][1:-1] for i in data if "All User Profile" in i]

#This line uses a list comprehension to extract the profile names from the data list.
Each line in data is checked if it contains the substring "All User Profile" using the if "All User Profile" in i condition.
If it does, the line is split using i.split(":"), and the second element [1] (which contains the profile name) is extracted.
[1:-1] is used to remove the surrounding quotes from the profile name.
The resulting profile names are stored in the 'profiles' list.



for i in profiles:
    results = (
        subprocess
        .check_output(["netsh", "wlan", "show", "profile", i, "key=clear"])
        .decode("utf-8")
        .split("\n")
    )

#This code initiates a loop over each profile name in the profiles list.
Within the loop, a new command is executed using " subprocess.check_output() ".
The command executed is"  netsh wlan show profile <profile_name> key=clear  ", where <profile_name> is replaced with the current profile name i.
The output of the command is obtained as a byte string, decoded to a string, and split into a list of lines, which is stored in the results variable.
python



results = [b.split(":")[1][1:-1] for b in results if "Key Content" in b]


#Another list comprehension is used here to extract the Wi-Fi passwords from the results list.
Each line in results is checked if it contains the substring "Key Content" using the if "Key Content" in b condition.
If it does, the line is split using b.split(":"), and the second element [1] (which contains the password) is extracted.
[1:-1] is used to remove the surrounding quotes from the password.
The resulting passwords are stored in the results list.


try:
    print("{:<30}|  {:<}".format(i, results[0]))
except IndexError:
    print("{:<30}|  {:<}".format(i, ""))


#This code prints the profile name and its corresponding Wi-Fi password.
The try block attempts to print the profile name and the first password in the results list using the print() function.
If results is empty (i.e., there are no passwords), an IndexError will be raised.
In the except block, an empty string is printed as the password.


##That's the end of the documentation for the provided code. It retrieves Wi-Fi profiles and their passwords using the Windows command prompt (netsh command) and displays them in a formatted manner.
